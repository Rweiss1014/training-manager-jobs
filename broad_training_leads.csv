Ever since our first credit card customer in 1994, Capital One has recognized that technology and data can enable even large companies to be innovative and personalized. As one of the first large enterprises to go all\-in on the public cloud, Capital One needed to build cloud and data management tools that didn’t exist in the marketplace to enable us to operate at scale in the cloud. And in 2022, we publicly announced Capital One Software and brought our first B2B software solution, Slingshot, to market.


Building on Capital One’s pioneering adoption of modern cloud and data capabilities, Capital One Software is helping accelerate the data management journey at scale for businesses operating in the cloud. If you think of the kind of challenges that companies face \- things like data publishing, data consumption, data governance, and infrastructure management \- we’ve built tools to address these various needs along the way. Capital One Software will continue to explore where we can bring our solutions to market to help other businesses address these same needs going forward.

* Team Leadership \& Sales Coaching  

Hire, onboard, and ramp SDRs; run regular 1:1s, live call coaching, and deal reviews; set clear expectations and development plans; build a culture of sales accountability, experimentation, and continuous improvement.
* Cross\-Functional Collaboration \& Feedback Loops  

Partner with AEs on account engagement plans and full\-funnel sales strategies; align SDR motions with Marketing campaigns and events; work with Enablement on sales messaging, objection handling, and competitive positioning; deliver structured field feedback to Product and Marketing.
* Systems, Data, and Reporting  

Ensure disciplined use of Salesforce, Groove, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo, and related tools; build and review SDR dashboards; use funnel data to diagnose bottlenecks and iterate on programs, KPIs, and playbooks.

 **Basic Qualifications**

* At least 5 years of experience in enterprise GTM roles such as sales, business development, partnerships, SDR, BDR, or inside sales, such as in SaaS or technology.

From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.
